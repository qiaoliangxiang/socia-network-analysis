Social Network Analysis
======================
This is the peer-evaluation programming project of the Coursera [Social Network Analysis class](https://www.coursera.org/course/sna).

The dataset was crawled and processed using Python. 
The analysis was performed using R.

More code and datasets will be uploaded later.


Introduction
============
Social networking is one of the important parts of our daily life because it enables us to communicate, exchange information and collaborate with others. We are interested in studying the arXiv GR-QC (General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology) collaboration network, and we created a data collection of papers submitted between July 1992 and November 2013. A variety of analyses and visualizations have been performed on the collaboration network. It is a scale-free network whose node degrees follow a power-law. The sizes of connected components also follow a power-law, and the giant component contains a large amount of authors. It is a small world network with six degrees of separation. The network contains 3553 communities with modularity 0.85. We also studied how the graph evolved over years and found the network was becoming denser and its diameter was shrinking.
